# MyReads: A Personal Book Collection React Application

The MyReads application is the final project in React Fundamentals part of the Udacity's React Developer Nanodgree program. This React application lets you search for books and add them to three separate book shelfs based off if you `Want to Read`, or you have `Read`, or am `Currently Reading` it.

This project was initially forked from the starter template found @ https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

Try out the application @ https://majorgamergeek.github.io/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/

## Running this app locally

Prerequisites - Node.js and NPM are required to be installed before you can build and run this project locally. https://nodejs.org

1) Open a Node.js console
2) `git clone` https://github.com/MajorGamerGeek/reactnd-project-myreads-starter
3) Change directory to the cloned project `cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter`
4) Perform an `npm start`
5) A browser window should automatically open and navigate to the running application at http://localhost:3000

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
